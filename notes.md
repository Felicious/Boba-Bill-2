# Developing using Vue

```
vue serve App.vue
```

As usual, Derrick taught me this. Vue is a UI **framework**, which provides foundation for software developers to build web programs. While this is the general definition of a framework, I'm not too sure how a UI framework is distinct from this definition, but I guess I'll learn as I go.

gcc is compiler
run the outputed binary filename.o

we use vue (UI framework)
