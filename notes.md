# How to Contribute

Develop and serve this project using Vue-Cli. To use, install Vue, and within the project folder in terminal,

```
vue create pearl-project
```

This command creates the vue project, and Vue will install the appropriate libraries and make the files that will help your project run on the browser.

Next, navigate inside the project folder and serve the project locally.

```
cd pearl-project
npm run serve
```

This will allow you to run a local development server from http://localhost:8080. Whenever you close the local server, simply return to `pearl-project` and run `npm run serve` once more.
